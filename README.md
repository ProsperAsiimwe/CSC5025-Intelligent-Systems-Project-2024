# CSC5025-Intelligent-Systems-Project-2024

## Project Overview
This project aims to design, implement, and analyze a Hybrid AI System for continuous learning, knowledge discovery, and interactive decision-making, specifically for share trading and investment decision-making on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

## Project Objectives
1. To design and analyze an architecture for a hybrid AI system for continuous learning, knowledge discovery, and interactive decision-making.
2. To implement and analyze a prototype system based on this architecture that includes continuous learning using STGNNs and a decision-making component using Bayesian Decision Networks.

### Phase 1: Continuous Learning using STGNNs
