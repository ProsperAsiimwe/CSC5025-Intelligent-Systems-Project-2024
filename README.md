# CSC5025-Intelligent-Systems-Project-2024

## Project Overview
This project aims to design, implement, and analyze a Hybrid AI System for continuous learning, knowledge discovery, and interactive decision-making, specifically for share trading and investment decision-making on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

## Project Objectives
1. To design and analyze an architecture for a hybrid AI system for continuous learning, knowledge discovery, and interactive decision-making.
2. To implement and analyze a prototype system based on this architecture that includes continuous learning using STGNNs and a decision-making component using Bayesian Decision Networks.

### Phase 1: Continuous Learning using STGNNs
- **Marks**: 30
- **Objective**: Design and evaluate the performance of a continuous learning component for situation analysis and situation prediction.
- **Start Date**: 16 September 2024
- **End Date**: 25 September 2024
- **Submission Deadline**: 25 September 2024

**Tasks**:
1. **Design an Experimental Pipeline**
   - Develop and analyze your model configurations through an appropriate machine learning experimental pipeline.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Source appropriate data and prepare, clean, and preprocess it.

3. **Experiment Design**
   - Design experiments to analyze and compare the performance and training times between different Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Graph Wave Network (GWN) configurations.

4. **Configuration Analysis**
   - Analyze the different configurations and identify the optimal configuration based on the following criteria:
   a. Model performance on the training and test set after a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 100; you should decide on a value to use).
   b. Stability of the model over three runs.
   c. Convergence of loss over the training epochs.
   d. Training time.

5. **Model Configuration Selection**
   - Select an optimal model configuration and design and implement appropriate mechanisms for model updates using this configuration.

6. **Reporting**
   - Write a report on the results, analysis, findings, and conclusions, including:
   a. A systematic analysis of the impact of varying different hyper-parameters.
   b. Appropriate graphs that show the change in training and test loss over the number of training epochs.
   c. A summary analysis of your experiments and how you selected the optimal configuration based on the specified criteria.

### Phase 2: Interactive Decision Making using BDN
- **Marks**: 30
- **Start Date**: 26 September 2024
- **End Date**: 7 October 2024
- **Submission Deadline**: 7 October 2024

**Tasks**:
- Design and evaluate a Bayesian Decision Network (more details to be provided).

### Phase 3: Final AI System Architecture and Prototype Implementation
- **Marks**: 40
- **Start Date**: 8 October 2024
- **End Date**: 17 October 2024
- **Submission Deadline**: 17 October 2024

**Tasks**:
- Architecture and prototype system with a fully integrated continuous learning and decision-making components. More details will be provided.
